# TDSico
A simple ICO Ethereum DApp

The TDS want to raise some funds to create a platform to sell its media content.
Bootstrapping such a platform requires some investment upfront. So, instead of asking money from a Bank, TDS can rely on its large fan base to contribute to such a project.
We need:
-	An Effective way to raise funds (easy to use)?
-	A Transparent way:  Who owns what?
-	A solution that is available and scalable?
-	A Fully digitized solution: no friction with the current financial system.
The best solution is an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) DApp (Decentralized Application) that consists of a HTML/CSS/Javascript front-end and an ethereum smart contract back-end.

This application will allow users to own a share of the project as TDS Tokens that will be available via an ERC20 token smart contract
These TDS Tokens can also be of utility on the target platform: for example giving  access to media content.
